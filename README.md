## Free Gyazo

Gyazo is a image provider that lets you take screenshots and gifs from your desktop. The only thing is... it only lets you use the 10 most recent images you've made and the others are hidden. But because they're not gone, we are able to still show them to you with this script!

Add this to your tampermonkey scripts and all the images / screenshots you've ever taken will be brought back!

## Installation
