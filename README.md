## Free Gyazo

Gyazo is a image provider that lets you take screenshots and gifs from your desktop. The only thing is... it only lets you use the 10 most recent images you've made and the others are hidden. But because they're not gone, we are able to still show them to you with this script!

Add this to your tampermonkey scripts and all the images / screenshots you've ever taken will be brought back!

## Installation

The installation is really simple! Don't need to download anything from this repository! If you already have tampermonkey installed, then you won't have to download anything and you're able to skip step 1!

1. Make sure you have Tampermonkey installed. If not, go to the chrome web store and install tampermonkey.
2. Open "tampermonkey script.user.js" on the repository page.
3. Click "raw", tampermonkey will automically open itself and ask you to install the script.
4. Click install and you're done! Now open gyazo.com and see what happends ;)
